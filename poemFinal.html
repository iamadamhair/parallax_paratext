   <body>"An Essay on Woman"
      <br>Mary Leapor</br><br xmlns=""></br><br />Woman, a pleasing but a short-lived flow'r,<br />Too soft for business and too weak for pow'r:<br />A wife in bondage, or neglected maid;<br />Despised, if ugly; if she's fair, betrayed.<br />'Tis wealth alone inspires ev'ry grace,<br />And calls the raptures to her plenteous[1] face.<br />What numbers for those charming features pine,<br />If blooming acres[1] round her temples twine!<br />Her lip the strawberry, and her eyes more bright<br />Than sparkling Venus in a frosty night;<br />Pale lilies fade and, when the fair appears,<br />Snow turns a negro[1] and dissolves in tears,<br />And, where the charmer treads her magic toe,<br />On English ground Arabian odours grow;<br />Till mighty Hymen[1] lifts his sceptred rod,<br />And sinks her glories with a fatal nod,<br />Dissolves her triumphs, sweeps her charms away,<br />And turns the goddess to her native clay.<br />But, Artemisia,[1] let your servant sing<br />What small advantage wealth and beauties bring.<br />Who would be wise, that knew Pamphilia's fate?<br />Or who be fair, and joined to Sylvia's mate?<br />Sylvia, whose cheeks are fresh as early day,<br />As ev'ning mild, and sweet as spicy May:<br />And yet that face her partial husband tires,<br />And those bright eyes, that all the world admires.<br />Pamphilia's wit who does not strive to shun,<br />Like death's infection or a dog-day's sun?<br />The damsels view her with malignant eyes,<br />The men are vexed to find a nymph so wise:<br />And wisdom only serves to make her know<br />The keen sensation of superior woe.<br />The secret whisper and the list'ning ear,<br />The scornful eyebrow and the hated sneer,<br />The giddy censures of her babbling kind,<br />With thousand ills that grate a gentle mind,<br />By her are tasted in the first degree,<br />Though overlooked by Simplicus and me.<br />Does thirst of gold a virgin's heart inspire,<br />Instilled by nature or a careful sire?<br />Then let her quit extravagance and play,<br />The brisk companion and expensive tea,<br />To feast with Cordia in her filthy sty<br />On stewed potatoes or on mouldy pie;<br />Whose eager[1] eyes stare ghastly at the poor,<br />And fright the beggars from her hated door;<br />In greasy clouts she wraps her smoky chin,<br />And holds that pride's a never-pardoned sin.<br />If this be wealth, no matter where it falls;<br />But save, ye Muses, save your Mira's[1] walls:<br />Still give me pleasing indolence and ease,<br />A fire to warm me and a friend to please.<br />Since, whether sunk in avarice or pride,<br />A wanton virgin or a starving bride;<br />Or wond'ring crowds attend her charming tongue,<br />Or, deemed an idiot, ever speaks the wrong;<br />Though nature armed us for the growing ill<br />With fraudful cunning and a headstrong will;<br />Yet, with ten thousand follies to her charge,<br />Unhappy woman's but a slave at large.

      1. Not only blooming but wealthy.<br />1. Not only hair but property.<br />1. Black, when set against the fair one's skin. The hyperbolic comparisons throughout
      this passage are intentionally ironic, as in Shakespeare's Sonnet 130.<br />1. The god of marriage.<br />1. Bridget Freemantle, given the name of an ancient patron of the arts.<br />1. fierce<br />1. Leapor's pen name.<br /></body>
